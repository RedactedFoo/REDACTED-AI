# railway.toml — Config-as-Code for REDACTED AI Swarm on Railway
# Attunes persistent Ollama inference, swarm worker recursion, and x402 micropayment gateway
# Place at repo root; Railway merges with dashboard (volumes, secrets, domains via UI)
# https://docs.railway.app/guides/config-as-code

[build]
  builder = "RAILPACK"          # Modern successor to Nixpacks; auto-detects Python/Bun/Docker
  # Optional: watchPaths = ["python/**", "agents/**", "x402.redacted.ai/**"]  # Trigger rebuilds on changes

[deploy]
  # Global-ish deploy hints (applied contextually)
  restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"  # Or ALWAYS for aggressive restarts
  restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10

# Service-specific overrides — Railway matches by name or root dir during deploy
# Use dashboard to create/link services, then these apply on push/deploy

# Ollama backend: persistent LLM server (CPU inference, volume for models)
[services.ollama-backend]
  image = "ollama/ollama:latest"
  startCommand = "serve"
  healthcheckPath = "/api/tags"          # Ollama health endpoint (lists models)
  healthcheckInterval = 30
  healthcheckTimeout = 10
  # Dashboard: add volume mount at /root/.ollama (persistent model storage)
  # Private network: accessible as http://ollama-backend.railway.internal:11434

# Swarm worker: persistent Python daemon (summon_agent in loop mode)
[services.swarm-worker]
  startCommand = "python python/summon_agent.py --agent agents/RedactedIntern.character.json --mode persistent --ollama-host http://ollama-backend.railway.internal:11434"
  healthcheckPath = "/health"            # If you add a simple Flask/endpoint for liveness; otherwise omit or use custom script
  healthcheckInterval = 60
  healthcheckTimeout = 30
  # Optional: rootDirectory = "/python"   # Scope build/deploy to subdir if needed
  # Env vars (add in dashboard): OLLAMA_HOST above, MILADY_PASSPHRASE, etc.

# x402 gateway: Bun/Express API with content negotiation + wallet proxy
[services.x402-gateway]
  startCommand = "bun run index.js"      # Direct Bun (fast, no PM2 needed for simple cases)
  # Alternative with PM2: "pm2-runtime start ecosystem.config.cjs --env production"
  healthcheckPath = "/health"            # Built-in health endpoint returns 200
  healthcheckInterval = 30
  healthcheckTimeout = 10
  # Dashboard: generate public domain for Phantom wallet connects (UI needs reachability)
  # Private network: swarm-worker can proxy paid calls internally if desired

# Shared environment variable defaults (override/fill secrets in dashboard)
[environment]
  PYTHONUNBUFFERED = "1"                 # Real-time Python logs
  NODE_ENV = "production"                # For Bun/Express
  PORT = "3000"                          # x402 default; Railway overrides externally
  # Add placeholders: PUBLIC_URL = "https://your-gateway.up.railway.app"
  # Secrets (dashboard only): SOLANA_RPC, MILADY_PASSPHRASE, WALLET_KEY (devnet only!)
